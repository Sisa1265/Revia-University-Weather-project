# 🌦️ Revia University Weather Project  

An IoT-based **weather station** developed as part of the *Systems Thinking in IT* course at FIIT STU.  
The project measures and visualizes **temperature, humidity, and air pressure** using a **Raspberry Pi** with environmental sensors.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal  
The main goal is to build a functional prototype that collects real-time weather data and displays it through an interactive dashboard.  
This project combines **IT technologies, teamwork, and practical product creation**.
